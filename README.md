# wellness_ui

A new Flutter project.

Wellness-UI like its name is the user interface of a mobile app thet focuses on working out. It consists of two screens, that show calories burnt, a user's weight, gym time, and more. Users have the ability to use the app's workout program.
This is however only the frontend, as I am currently focusing on improving my 
skills. It is built with Flutter.
The app's theme is black, orange, grey and white, and the inspiration was gotten from dribbble.
